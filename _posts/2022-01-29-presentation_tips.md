* If importing figures from paper, avoid including the captions.
* Include lot of images and less maths
* Talk should end with summary and not the future work or thank you slide or something.
* Cite the references on the same slide in bottom.

Refere to "Giving talks" section of [this blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/).

### Dos and Don'ts

* Never put too detailed information difficult to grasp: a table with many numbers, a complex derivation all in one go, very complicated diagram.
